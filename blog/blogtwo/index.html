          Reflect on Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution?
          Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’. How does it speak to the
          internet today? I do find it interesting how Theodor Holm Nelson's
          concept of "Xanadu" was far removed from what we would consider the
          internet today. The concept of a free structured internet is a bit
          strange to think about given how much of it is now only accessible
          when using certain Web Browsers, Google has 78.83 of the global
          desktop search market (Bianchi, T., 2025), hypertext as suggested has
          reached a kind of homogeny where most content falling under a certain
          category, say music, is held up by big corporations who we have little
          to no choice but to use if we want to access said information making
          the market highly restrictive. This is contrary to the vision that
          Nelson had that the system would set us free.

          My user alignment I believe would be anyone in tech or gamers who
          appreciate that design approach, a design like that of Bandai Namco or
          Kojima Productions' website is something that I find really
          interesting...<br /><a href="blogthree/index.html">read more.</a>

          I want my user to focus on the text and items displayed on the screen
          without much interference. To further this I've made use of space and
          bold, big text to capture the user's attention and guide them to page
          elements that are relevant for that scroll, I want to curate what they
          see, e.g., on my home page when the user scrolls down the previously
          displayed text...<br /><a href="blogfour/index.html">read more.</a>
