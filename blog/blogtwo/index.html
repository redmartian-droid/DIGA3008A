          Reflect on Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution?
          Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’. How does it speak to the
          internet today? I do find it interesting how Theodor Holm Nelson's
          concept of "Xanadu" was far removed from what we would consider the
          internet today. The concept of a free structured internet is a bit
          strange to think about given how much of it is now only accessible
          when using certain Web Browsers, Google has 78.83 of the global
          desktop search market (Bianchi, T., 2025), hypertext as suggested has
          reached a kind of homogeny where most content falling under a certain
          category, say music, is held up by big corporations who we have little
          to no choice but to use if we want to access said information making
          the market highly restrictive. This is contrary to the vision that
          Nelson had that the system would set us free.
