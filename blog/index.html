           thanks to some prior knowledge setting up Github was not too difficult. i do find publishing to pages a bit confusing but that comes so from my own difficulty navigating my github page. the "A Little History of the World Wide Web" caught me by surprise, as much as i know about the internet i had always just assumed, in part thanks to the "Transformer" film, that the US military had a hand in making it. instead its a lot more like a collabarative effort between all so. as much as they may hae helped lay the groundwork, in whatever capacity they may have had, it took a lot more people to really build on top of that to get it to resemble what we know today. i will say that reading up, the internet was far from being what we know today, especially with only recently being brough into homes through the "internet in a box" approach, without o'reily and co. who knows how using the internet would look today. around the 2000s it would seem that websites moved away from mostly being text based, with Audioscrobbler reminding me of an early Spotify in functionality and you can really see technologies started to move towards what we are most familiar with today. my goals for this course is just to streamline what i know on html and try to really ingrain it into my dna so it comes as naturally as breathing. another is to learn industry best practices.
